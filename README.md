# BaseUTF16-encode-decode
Akin to Base64, UUEncode and YEncoding protocols, this encoder/decoder encodes a datastream to a standard-compliant UTF16 representation suitable for use in JavaScript  localStorage and other spots where JavaSctript strings are expected rather than random binary data. Use this encoder to fully utilize the storage space offered by JavaScript technology.
